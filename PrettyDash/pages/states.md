###### some states suffer far worse than others
Comparing wildfires in different states in the year 2022 reveals that states have drastically different experiences with this *mostly-natural* disaster. As expected in a case with wildfires, southern -- especially southwestern states -- tend to fair the worst per-capita, and the two states with the most wildfires both reside in 
the south-western quarter of the country. This is also a steep drop, California and Texas lead the charge by huge margins.
#### california and texas
While sitting in an arid, south-western desert ecosystem can certainly help to provoke fires, there are other arid states such as Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona that still see shockingly less wildfires than Texas or California. 
It cannot simply be the dry air and tender that is causing uncontrolled fires. There are certainly other things to note about these two states specifically. Firstly, both of these states are enormous and still have a lot 
of open forest and area, allowing wildfires to spread more contagiously than they typically would in a more urban area. Another thing to note is, despite being mostly empty, both California and Texas have huge populations. None 
of these measurements are taking `per capita` into consideration, so it is important to remember that if 85-percent of wildfires are started by people, then more people means more wildfires.
## North Carolina
One of the more shocking relationships on this dashboard is North Carolina reaching the top-5 states for wildfire count. Considering all that we have assumed and learned about wildfires so far, it seems hard to believe that a state with the 
properties of North Carolina would fall under the same umbrella.
