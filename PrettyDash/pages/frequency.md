###### frequency vs acres
A key thing to note is that the 2020s, as a decade, have seen a steep rise in wildfires in the United States. This seems to be following a global trend, and likely isn't due to anything 
the United States specifically is doing. What is interesting, however, is that the number of acres burned by each fire has decreased with this increase in the number of fires. Is it possible that 
this just means more, smaller fires are being reported? Or does this have more interesting ramifactions, have officials been overseeing an unprecedented response to wildfires?

Another thing to note is where these fires tend to happen. Of course, the fires are happening more often in dryer regions, but this is not necessarily the trend. For example, North Carolina makes the top-5 and resides 
far more North than most other states it is being compared to. What exactly is the issue that leads to a wildfire, specifically? Is it the location? The humidity? Is it the number of people, or the number of trees?
